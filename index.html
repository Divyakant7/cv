   <h3>Experience</h3>
   <h4>Widhya</h4>
   <h5>Machine learning Intern</h5>
   <ul>
    <li>Develop a model which one predict the Flight Delay time by given data after implementation of a suitable algorithm.</li>
    <li>Develop a model which predict Stock price prediction by given data after implementation of a suitable algorithm.</li>
    <li>I understand how to model a solution using the example of COVID-19 pandemic.I first go through the data,make some
visualization and understand what mathematical method can be used to predict future number of cases.</li>
    <li>Develop a model which process a simple data set that has been taken from instagram and try to predict how many
people the post will reach at a particular timeframe depending on the number of followers.</li>
   </ul>
   <h4> TechKriti'20</h4>
   <h5>Workshop on machine learning and IOT</h5>
   <ul>
    <li>Attend a workshop on machine learnig and IOT and learn much more intresting stuff,regarding different type of machine learning model and IOT stuff</li>
   </ul>
   <hr>
    <h3>Projects</h3>
   <h4>Self help website</h4>
   <h5>Html, Css, JavaScript, PHP, Mysql</h5>
   <ul>
    <li>Develop a website which contains book pdf ,notes ,and blogs related to Machine Learning ,Web Development
,Algorithm,and coding practice question</li>
    <li>There are some senior and Alumani who mentor students in specific field related to users intrest,and provide some special
resources related to the cource the user selected</li>
    <li>This website contains login and logout facility for users and if user want to help other student then they can also upload
material and help other.</li>
   </ul>
   <h4> Personal portfolio</h4>
   <h5>Html, Css, JavaScript</h5>
   <ul>
    <li>Use only basic Html ,CSS, JavaScript, for this portfolio,this portfolio contains all details about me ,Area of interest in
technology ,education background,personal project, and experience etc.</li>
    <li>This portfolio is static in nature and fully responsive,and contains all detail about me</li>
   </ul>
   <h4>Handwritten digit recognition</h4>
   <h5>Keras, MNIST dataset, CNN model</h5>
   <ul>
    <li>Download the dataset from keras mnist dataset for traning and tasting the model,for traing and testing , I divide the
dataset in two part one for traing the model and after traing the model we test the model my testing dataset.</li>
    <li>On this data set we use CNN model , sequential model and and maxdrop</li>
    <li>By using all mention model we achieve 98.0+ accuracy</li>
   </ul>
